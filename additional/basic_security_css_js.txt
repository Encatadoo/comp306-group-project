Security:
->Never connect to the database as a superuser or as the database owner. 
->Use always customized users with very limited privileges.
->Use prepared statements with bound variables. They are provided by PDO, by MySQLi and by other libraries.
->Check if the given input has the expected data type. PHP has a wide range of input validating functions,
from the simplest ones found in Variable Functions and in Character Type Functions
(e.g. is_numeric(), ctype_digit() respectively) and onwards to the Perl compatible Regular Expressions 
support.If the application waits for numerical input, consider verifying data with ctype_digit(),
 or silently change its type using settype(), or use its numeric representation by sprintf().
